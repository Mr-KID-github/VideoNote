# Repository Guidelines

## Architecture Overview
VINote is a full-stack video-to-note workspace with three moving parts:

- Backend: FastAPI API for downloading media, transcribing audio, generating Markdown notes, managing per-user LLM model profiles plus STT profiles, and handling team workspaces plus team membership.
- Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript app for authentication, note generation, personal/team note browsing, editing, team management, and settings.
- Database/Auth: Postgres-backed storage plus FastAPI-issued JWT auth stored in an HttpOnly cookie.

The backend can also run as a lightweight MCP server through `mcp_server.py`.

## Project Structure
- `app/`
  - `routers/`: FastAPI route modules. `note.py` exposes generation/status APIs plus task-artifact media routes. `note_library.py` also exposes authenticated saved-note media playback routes. `teams.py` exposes authenticated team and membership APIs. `share.py` exposes authenticated share-link APIs plus public shared-note routes. `model_profiles.py` exposes authenticated LLM model-profile APIs. `stt_profiles.py` exposes authenticated STT profile APIs. `mcp.py` exposes the LAN HTTP MCP endpoint at `/mcp`.
  - `services/`: orchestration and domain services.
    - `note_service.py`: main pipeline coordinator.
    - `mcp_service.py`: shared MCP tool definitions and JSON-RPC request handling used by both the stdio server and the HTTP `/mcp` endpoint.
    - `note_media_service.py`: selects key moments, then adds heading timestamps and screenshot markers for those moments after summarization.
    - `transcription_service.py`: per-task transcriber selection, chunking, ffmpeg/ffprobe helpers.
    - `llm_service.py`: resolves LLM config from request overrides, saved model profiles, or env defaults.
    - `stt_profile_service.py`: resolves STT config from per-run selection, saved STT profiles, or env defaults.
    - `task_artifact_service.py`: persists status/result/transcript/markdown artifacts under `output/`.
    - `model_profile_*`: encrypted model profile CRUD and connection testing.
    - `stt_profile_*`: encrypted STT profile CRUD and provider-specific normalization.
    - `auth_service.py`: local email/password auth plus JWT cookie validation for protected APIs.
    - `team_repository.py`: team CRUD, membership management, and team access checks.
    - `share_service.py`: builds public share URLs and renders read-only shared-note HTML.
    - `screenshot_service.py`: replaces `[[Screenshot:mm:ss]]` placeholders with extracted frame images.
  - `downloaders/`: media download/extraction adapters built around `yt-dlp`.
  - `transcribers/`: speech-to-text providers (`groq`, `whisper`, `faster-whisper`, `sensevoice`, `sensevoice-local`).
  - `llm/`: summarizer implementations and prompt templates.
  - `models/`: Pydantic/dataclass request, response, and domain models.
- `frontend/src/`
  - `pages/`: route-level screens such as home, generator, notes, editor, login, team, and settings.
  - `components/`: reusable UI building blocks.
  - `stores/`: Zustand stores for auth, theme, note generation, note library, team workspace selection, model profiles, STT profiles, and language.
  - `lib/`: API wrapper, Supabase client, i18n copy, and model/STT profile client helpers.
- `supabase/`: local Supabase config, start scripts, and SQL migrations.
- `tests/`: backend unit tests.
- `docs/plans/`: product/design implementation notes.
- `docs/.vitepress/`: standalone VitePress docs site config and navigation.
- `docs/en/`: English docs pages paired with the default Simplified Chinese docs.
- `data/`: downloaded audio/video cache and temporary transcription chunks.
- `output/`: per-task artifacts and generated Markdown notes.

## Runtime Flow
1. Frontend signs users in against FastAPI auth endpoints and browser requests carry the HttpOnly auth cookie to `/api/*`.
2. `NoteService` creates a task directory under `output/`, downloads or prepares audio, and updates `status.json`.
3. `TranscriptionService` loads the selected transcriber, optionally chunks long audio, and saves `transcript.json`.
4. `LLMService` resolves the active model configuration and generates Markdown from transcript segments using the requested summary mode (`default`, `accurate`, or `oneshot`).
5. `TranscriptionService` resolves the active STT configuration in this order: request `stt_profile_id` > signed-in user's default STT profile > `.env` `TRANSCRIBER_*` defaults.
6. `NoteMediaService` enriches the generated Markdown with section-level timestamp jump links and screenshot markers, then `ScreenshotService` downloads the full video and injects extracted frames.
7. `TaskArtifactService` writes `note.md`, `result.json`, `status.json`, and the `.task_id` mapping.
8. Frontend polls `/api/task/{task_id}`, stores the final note row together with `task_id` in the backend `notes` table under either the current personal workspace or a selected team workspace, renders key moments as timestamp-and-screenshot cards, shows the source media beside preview content when available, seeks embedded video or extracted audio when note timestamps are clicked, and can optionally generate a public `/share/{token}` link for LAN access.

## Environment and Configuration
Backend settings live in root `.env` and are loaded by `app/config.py`.

Important backend variables:
- `LLM_*`: default summarizer provider/model/base URL/API key.
- `TRANSCRIBER_TYPE`: `groq`, `whisper`, `faster-whisper`, `sensevoice`, or `sensevoice-local`. This is still the fallback when no STT profile is selected.
- `TRANSCRIBER_TYPE=faster-whisper` also requires `requirements.local-transcribers.txt` to be installed.
- `GROQ_API_KEY`: required when using `groq`.
- `WHISPER_*`, `FASTER_WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE`, `SENSEVOICE_*`: provider-specific transcription settings.
- `SUMMARY_DEFAULT_MAX_CHARS`, `SUMMARY_DEFAULT_MAX_SEGMENTS`: thresholds that decide when `default` mode upgrades from one-shot to hierarchical summarization.
- `SUMMARY_CHUNK_MAX_CHARS`, `SUMMARY_CHUNK_MAX_SEGMENTS`, `SUMMARY_CHUNK_OVERLAP_SEGMENTS`: chunk sizing controls for hierarchical summarization.
- `APP_JWT_SECRET`, `AUTH_COOKIE_*`: backend-issued session cookie settings.
- `DATABASE_URL`: required database connection string.
- `SHARE_BASE_URL`: optional override for generated public share links; when empty, the backend tries to infer a LAN URL automatically.
- `MODEL_PROFILE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: required to store/decrypt model profile API keys.
  - the same encryption key is also used for Groq STT profile API keys

Frontend Vite settings live in `frontend/.env.local`:
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (leave empty for the local Vite proxy, or set an absolute backend URL)
- `VITE_DOCS_BASE_URL` (optional absolute docs-site URL; when empty the app falls back to backend Swagger docs)
  - local dev special case: when the frontend runs on port `3100`, the sidebar `Document` link defaults to `http://localhost:3101/`

Raspberry Pi deployment defaults live in `deploy/pi/local.env`:
- `PI_HOST`, `PI_USER`, `PI_PORT`: SSH connection target for bootstrap and deploy scripts
- `PI_REMOTE_DIR`: remote app directory used by bootstrap and deploy scripts
- `PI_ENV_FILE`: root-level env file that should be uploaded to the Pi during deploy

## Testing and Verification
The repository already contains backend tests under `tests/`.

Recommended checks after code changes:
- Backend unit tests: `pytest tests`
- Frontend type/build check: `cd frontend && npm run build`
- Docs build check: `cd docs && npm run docs:build`
- API smoke check: open `http://127.0.0.1:8900/docs`
- MCP smoke check: `POST http://127.0.0.1:8900/mcp` with JSON-RPC `initialize` or `tools/list`
- Pipeline smoke check: run one sample generation and inspect the created folder under `output/`
- Share-link smoke check: generate one note, click Share in the editor, and open the returned `/share/{token}` URL from another LAN device

## Coding and Collaboration Rules
- Python: follow PEP 8, keep route handlers thin, keep orchestration in `app/services/`.
- TypeScript: keep `strict` compatibility intact, use `PascalCase` for components and `camelCase` for helpers/hooks.
- Prefer focused modules over large multi-purpose files.
- Do not commit generated artifacts from `data/`, `output/`, frontend build output, or local Supabase temp files unless the change explicitly targets them.
- Preserve user changes in a dirty worktree; do not revert unrelated edits.

## Documentation Maintenance
Update `README.md`, this `AGENTS.md`, or both whenever you change:
- runtime ports or startup commands
- environment variables or required services
- API routes or authentication requirements
- project structure or module ownership
- major user-facing flows in the frontend

## Notes for Agents
- The current frontend does not yet upload local files from the browser, even though backend file-based generation endpoints exist.
- The note generator UI exposes both LLM profile selection and STT profile selection; `default` summary mode still auto-switches to hierarchical summarization for longer transcripts.
- Share links are public read-only links backed by `notes.share_token` and can be disabled from the note editor.
- Saved notes are now explicitly scoped as either personal notes or team notes. Team notes require `scope="team"` plus a valid `team_id`, and any signed-in team member can open them through the normal note APIs.
- If documentation and code disagree, trust the code, then fix the documentation in the same change.
