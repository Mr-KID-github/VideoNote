# Local and Raspberry Pi Deployment

## Local development

Backend:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8900 --reload
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Docs site:

```bash
cd docs
npm run docs:dev
```

## Default ports

- Backend API and Swagger: `8900`
- Frontend app: `3100`
- Docs site: `3101`

## Local Docker runtime

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts:

- `postgres`
- `backend`
- `frontend`
- `docs`

## Raspberry Pi deployment

VINote supports two Pi deployment paths:

- Manual deployment from a developer machine
- Automatic deployment from GitHub Actions on a Pi self-hosted runner

### Manual deployment

Recommended order:

1. Create the root `.env` from `.env.example`
2. Create `deploy/pi/local.env` from `deploy/pi/local.env.example`
3. Run bootstrap first so Docker, Docker Compose, and the remote app directory are ready
4. Run deploy after bootstrap completes

Bootstrap:

```powershell
.\deploy\pi\bootstrap-pi.ps1
```

```bash
./deploy/pi/bootstrap-pi.sh
```

Deploy:

```powershell
.\deploy\pi\deploy-pi-interactive.ps1
```

```bash
./deploy/pi/deploy-pi-interactive.sh
```

```powershell
.\deploy\pi\deploy-pi.ps1
```

```bash
./deploy/pi/deploy-pi.sh
```

The manual path still exists as the fallback for emergency redeploys and debugging.

### Automatic deployment on `dev`

The recommended shared test-environment flow is:

- merge into `dev`
- GitHub Actions picks up the push
- the Pi self-hosted runner checks out the merged commit
- the Pi rebuilds and restarts the app locally

Workflow details:

- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy-pi-dev.yml`
- Trigger: `push` to `dev` and `workflow_dispatch`
- Runner labels: `self-hosted`, `linux`, `arm`, `pi`, `vinote-test`
- GitHub Environment: `pi-test`
- Local deploy script on the runner: `deploy/pi/deploy-from-checkout.sh`

### One-time runner setup

On the Raspberry Pi:

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose
2. Install a GitHub Actions self-hosted runner under a separate directory such as `/home/zouyu/actions-runner`
3. Register it with the labels `self-hosted,linux,arm,pi,vinote-test`
4. Install the runner as a service
5. Add the runner user to the `docker` group
6. Keep the deployed app under `/home/zouyu/vinote`

Do not use the app directory as the runner work directory.

### Step-by-step setup checklist

On the Raspberry Pi:

1. Sign in with the user that should own both the runner and `/home/zouyu/vinote`.
2. Install Docker and Docker Compose if they are not already installed.
3. Create the app directory and persistent folders:

```bash
mkdir -p /home/zouyu/vinote/data /home/zouyu/vinote/output
```

4. Create a dedicated runner work directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /home/zouyu/actions-runner
cd /home/zouyu/actions-runner
```

5. In GitHub, open `Settings -> Actions -> Runners -> New self-hosted runner`.
6. Choose Linux and ARM, then copy the commands GitHub gives you.
7. Run those commands on the Pi and set the labels to:
   `self-hosted,linux,arm,pi,vinote-test`
8. Install and start the runner service:

```bash
sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo ./svc.sh start
```

9. Add the runner user to the `docker` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker zouyu
```

10. Restart the runner service after the group change:

```bash
sudo ./svc.sh stop
sudo ./svc.sh start
```

Quick verification:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version || docker-compose version
id -nG
sudo ./svc.sh status
```

### GitHub Environment `pi-test`

Configure these values in GitHub:

- Secret `PI_TEST_ENV_FILE`
  - full contents of the root `.env` for the Pi test environment
- Variable `PI_REMOTE_DIR`
  - default `/home/zouyu/vinote`
- Variable `FRONTEND_PORT`
  - default `3100`
- Variable `BACKEND_PORT`
  - default `8900`
- Variable `DOCS_PORT`
  - default `3101`

GitHub-side checklist:

1. Open `Settings -> Environments`.
2. Create `pi-test`.
3. Add secret `PI_TEST_ENV_FILE` with the full contents of the Pi `.env`.
4. Add variables `PI_REMOTE_DIR=/home/zouyu/vinote`, `FRONTEND_PORT=3100`, `BACKEND_PORT=8900`, and `DOCS_PORT=3101`.
5. Leave reviewer approval disabled if `dev` should deploy automatically after merge.
6. Confirm the `Deploy Pi Test Environment` workflow appears under the Actions tab.

### Automatic deployment behavior

The workflow:

1. checks out the triggering commit on the Pi runner
2. writes `.env` from `PI_TEST_ENV_FILE`
3. validates Docker, Docker Compose, `curl`, and docker-group membership
4. runs `deploy/pi/deploy-from-checkout.sh`
5. rebuilds and restarts the stack with `docker compose up -d --build --remove-orphans`
6. smoke-checks backend, frontend, and docs on `127.0.0.1`
7. prints `docker compose ps`
8. dumps backend/frontend/docs logs on failure

The deploy script refreshes the app directory but preserves `data/` and `output/`.

### What manual trigger means in practice

If you do not want every merge to `dev` to update the shared LAN environment immediately, the safer approach is to keep only `workflow_dispatch` and trigger deployment manually after your local checks and PR CI are green.

Manual trigger does not mean running deployment commands on your laptop. It means using the GitHub Actions UI:

1. Open the repository
2. Go to `Actions`
3. Open `Deploy Pi Test Environment`
4. Click `Run workflow`
5. Choose the branch to deploy, usually `dev`
6. Confirm the run

GitHub then schedules the job, the Pi self-hosted runner picks it up, and the Pi deploys locally.

If you later enable Environment reviewers, GitHub will pause before deployment until someone approves it. Without reviewers, manual trigger is simply a button in the Actions page.

### Data retention and deployment safety

With the current deployment design, a normal deploy should preserve existing shared data, notes, and generated artifacts.

Why data is retained:

- Postgres uses a named Docker volume in `docker-compose.yml`
- `deploy-from-checkout.sh` refreshes the code checkout but keeps `data/` and `output/`
- the workflow uses `docker compose up -d --build --remove-orphans`
- the workflow does not run `docker compose down -v`

What is normally preserved after deploy:

- database-backed users, teams, notes, and settings
- existing files under `/home/zouyu/vinote/data`
- existing files under `/home/zouyu/vinote/output`

What can still cause data loss or an unsafe deploy:

- manually running `docker compose down -v`
- manually deleting Docker volumes
- manually deleting `/home/zouyu/vinote/data` or `/home/zouyu/vinote/output`
- changing `PI_REMOTE_DIR` by mistake
- changing `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` so Compose points at a different project
- introducing destructive database migrations

Recommended practice for a shared LAN environment:

- validate locally first
- wait for PR CI to finish
- trigger Pi deployment manually when you are ready to update the shared environment
- treat `docker compose down -v` as a destructive recovery command, not a normal deployment command

## LAN notes

- When `SHARE_BASE_URL` is empty, the backend will infer a LAN share URL when possible
- If the frontend should point to a separate docs site, set `VITE_DOCS_BASE_URL`
- Manual scripts remain the operational fallback even after automatic deployment is enabled
- More Pi-specific notes live in `deploy/pi/README.md`
